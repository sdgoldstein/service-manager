# Service Manager Framework

The Service Manager Framework is a versatile API designed to enable the process of creating, instantiating, and managing services.  A service is an independent layer of functionality that is provided through an API interface.  This framework provides a foundation for dependency injection and lifecycle management of services, enabling developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. 

Three programming languages are supported: Java, TypeScript, and Python, making it accessible to a wide range of projects.
