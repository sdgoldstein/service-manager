# Service Manager Framework

The Service Manager Framework provides an API to enable dependency injection and lifecycle management of services, enabling developers to build modular and maintainable applications with less boilerplate code. A service is defined as an configurable, independent layer of functionality that is provided through an API interface.  

To make the framework accessible to a wide range of projects, it's available in three programming languages: Java, TypeScript, and Python.
